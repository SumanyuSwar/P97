                <p id="linux">Linux is both an open-source Unix-like kernel and a generic name for a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus. The mascot of the linux OS is a penguin called Tux</p>

                <br><br><br>
                <p id="distributions">Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME, KDE Plasma or Xfce. Distributions intended for servers may not have a graphical user interface at all, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <p id="Uses">Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e., devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart home devices, video game consoles,[30] televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs),[31][32][33] automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota),[34] and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule, and the Perseverance rover).[35][36]

                    Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source code may be used, modified, and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). The Linux kernel, for example, is licensed under the GPLv2, with an exception for system calls that allows code that calls the kernel via system calls not to be licensed under the GPL.
